该文件为1.20更新前62球蓝图代码
蓝图没有本体文件，只能用记事本保存代码
打开游戏搓球界面，将代码粘贴即可，大球粘贴也许会卡，也可能会有部分球会报错。<br>This file is the blueprint code of the first 62 balls updated in 1.20
The blueprint does not have an ontology file, and the code can only be saved in Notepad
Open the ball rubbing interface of the game, just paste the code, the large ball may get stuck, and some balls may report an error.


绝大部分球都不是最大半径球（防止炸档），只能作创意参考，想搞极限电量的兄嘚看看就成。
有一个戴森球有错误，我不说是谁O(∩_∩)O
希望能抛砖引玉，搓出更离谱的球来。

Most of the spheres are not the spheres with the largest radius (to prevent explosions), so they can only be used as a reference for creativity. Those who want to use the limit power can just take a look.
There is a Dyson Shere with an error, I don't say who it is O(∩_∩)O
I hope that I can throw bricks to attract jade and make even more outrageous balls.
